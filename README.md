### 🔒 Activity & Code Visibility

> **⚠️ Note to Hiring Managers:**
>
> The majority of my recent engineering work (including the core logic for *Barakaldo Berria* and *Gidatu*) resides in **private commercial repositories** due to IP and security reasons.
>
> My public contribution graph does not reflect my actual daily coding activity. However, **I am happy to walk through my architecture, code patterns, and live deployments via screen share** during an interview process.
